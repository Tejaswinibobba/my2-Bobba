> jQuery hasAttr checking to see if there is an attribute on an element<br>
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1318076/jquery-hasattr-checking-to-see-if-there-is-an-attribute-on-an-element)

Get the attribute, check the value
```
var attr = $(this).attr('name');

// For some browsers, `attr` is undefined; for others, `attr` is false. Check for both.
if (typeof attr !== typeof undefined && attr !== false) {
  // Element has this attribute
}
```
Native JavaScript has a way
```
$(this)[0].hasAttribute("name");
jQObject[0].hasAttribute("name");
```
Filter the selection
```
$(this).is('[name]');
$(this).filter("[name='choice']");
```
